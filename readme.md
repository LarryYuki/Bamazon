# Bamazon App
---
## Overview
---
### Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## Customer Portal

### The Bamazon app prompts users with two messages. One that ask the customer the ID of the product they would like to buy. The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy.
### Once the customer has placed the order, the Bamazon app should check if there is enough of the product to meet the customer's request. And show the total cost of the purchase.
